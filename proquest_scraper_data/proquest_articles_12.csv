New York Times Company,"United States, New York","Jul 3, 2019",Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Blocking Trump From Using Defense Funds for Border Wall,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Wednesday upheld a block on President Trump’s attempt to use $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense to construct a wall along the southwestern border, impeding the delivery of one of his signature campaign promises.
The divided three-judge panel in the Ninth Circuit agreed with a lower court’s decision from Friday that ruled the Trump administration did not have the authority to reallocate the funds without congressional approval. The administration immediately appealed.
Two of the three judges on the panel affirmed that the administration could not build the barriers during future challenges.
“We conclude that it is best served by respecting the Constitution’s assignment of the power of the purse to Congress, and by deferring to Congress’s understanding of the public interest as reflected in its repeated denial of more funding for border barrier construction,” wrote Judges Michelle Friedland, an Obama appointee, and Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush appointee.
Judge N. Randy Smith, also a Bush appointee, dissented, calling the ruling “an uncharted and risky approach.”
“This approach is in contradiction to the most fundamental concepts of judicial review,” Judge Smith said. “The majority has created a constitutional issue where none previously existed.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Sierra Club, hailed the freezing of the funds as a victory.
“Congress and now two courts have said no to border wall funds,” Dror Ladin, a staff attorney with the A.C.L.U., said in a statement Friday. “For the sake of our democracy and border communities, it’s time the president come to terms with the fact that America rejected his xenophobic wall — and move on.”
As a surge of migrants arrived at the United States border, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency in February to reallocate funds from counterdrug programs of the Department of Defense to build more barriers. This came after a monthslong impasse between the White House and Congress, and a partial government shutdown over funding construction of the wall.
The move to reallocate the funds, which critics of the administration said contradicted the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution, was then challenged in two separate lawsuits.
Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California temporarily blocked part of Mr. Trump’s plan to build the wall in May. On Friday, Judge Gilliam again blocked the efforts, describing the plan as “unlawful.”
On Tuesday, a federal judge in Seattle blocked another attempt by the administration to deter migration.
Judge Marsha J. Pechman of United States District Court for the Western District of Washington stopped the administration from denying a bond hearing to migrants who crossed the border illegally, which would have kept them jailed until they received a decision on an immigration case.
The administration on Wednesday called that ruling “at war with the rule of law.”

Newstex,"United States, Washington","Sep 16, 2019",College Athletes Should Be Able to Earn Money From Their Likeness,"Scott Kinser/Cal Sport Media via AP Images
Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Tua Tagovailoa at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina 
California Senator Nancy Skinner’s Senate Bill 206 would permit athletes to earn outside compensation from the use of their own name, image, and likeness (NIL)—and it unanimously flew through both houses of the state legislature. SB206, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature, has drawn sharp warnings from the NCAA, as the bill threatens its ability to exploit college athletes participating under its model of “amateurism.”
Given the NCAA’s threats, one might assume that the bill’s passage would result in some cataclysmic event, threatening the very existence of college sports. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The act would merely allow athletes to enjoy (almost) the same rights over their own identities that every student at their school enjoys, unencumbered by NCAA cartel restrictions. Even these rights are limited, as athletes could not enter into an agreement that conflicts with a team’s existing contracts.
The prospect of returning even a portion of NIL rights to college athletes has prompted howls of dismay from the NCAA and its acolytes. On June 17, 2019, NCAA President Mark Emmert sent a letter requesting that the State Senate postpone consideration of the bill. More recently, the NCAA informed Governor Newsom that it regarded the bill as “unconstitutional,” signaling an intention to rely on the Constitution’s Commerce Clause to raise a legal challenge. The letter also claimed that SB206 would upend the “level playing field” that the NCAA claims it has supported in college athletics. 
Those familiar with the O’Bannon v. NCAA case may be hard pressed to stifle their laughter upon seeing the NCAA trot out such risible, well-refuted claims. During the O’Bannon trial, plaintiffs’ counsel presented a quote from NCAA special advisor Wally Renfro, a 40-year veteran of the institution, who in an email titled “Financial Underpinnings of Athletics,” referred to Division I membership as “the haves, the have-nots, and the forget-about-its.” Indeed, so wide is the disparity that the “Power Five” conference football programs routinely make “guarantee game” payments to smaller teams. For example, Tulane received $1.94 million for playing SEC powerhouse Auburn earlier this year. In her O’Bannon ruling, District Judge Claudia Wilken, citing academic consensus on the matter, rejected the NCAA’s competitive balance justification, opining that:
The NCAA does not do anything to rein in spending by the high-revenue schools or minimize existing disparities in revenue and recruiting … the major conferences—and the highest revenue schools—typically receive the greatest payouts, which hinders, rather than promotes, competitive balance.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Wilken’s ruling on this point. In the subsequent Alston v. NCAA case, the NCAA, perhaps sensing a lost cause, did not even request that the court reconsider its competitive balance justification for its restraint on athlete compensation. 
Some athletes can already be paid in cash for their athletic talents. NCAA athletes competing in the Olympics receive cash payment for medaling in their sport. As CBS’s Dennis Dodd pointed out in 2018, University of Texas swimmer Joseph Schooling received $753,000 as payment for his gold medal from his native Singapore. He still won six medals at the NCAA championships. Kyler Murray received a $4.7 million bonus from the Oakland Athletics, yet remained eligible to quarterback the Oklahoma Sooners. As long as this was not football money, the NCAA concluded that he was eligible to keep playing, though his college baseball career was over.
Clearly the NCAA’s real concern lies with the prospect that college athletes in the major revenue sports of basketball and football might receive something more than table scraps for the extraordinary sums they garner for their schools. Those arguing that athletes receive an “education” in exchange for their 40-plus hours per week of labor and the millions they bring to the school may want to revisit the long-standing academic fraud case at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, one of the most respected public universities in the nation.
Nonetheless, the NCAA’s “level playing field” canard does signal at least an attempt, serious or not, to lean on Ninth Circuit precedent set in the 1992 NCAA v. Miller case, which involved NCAA sanctions against then-coach Jerry Tarkanian and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. There, the NCAA challenged various provisions of Nevada statute NRS 398 that set forth the state’s guidelines for the imposition of NCAA sanctions upon any college or university in the state. The district court found that the Nevada statute was “significantly burdensome on the NCAA’s objective of maintaining a ‘level playing field’ within intercollegiate athletics.” The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the practical effect of the regulation would have been to control conduct beyond the state’s boundaries.
However, this finding has little relevance for the California State Senate Bill. State and federal legislators have begun to chip away at the NCAA cartel’s economic control over college athletes. South Carolina lawmakers recently announced plans to file a bill similar to SB206. North Carolina Representative Mark Walker has introduced H.R. 1804, the Student-Athlete Equity Act, which has been referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. Representative Walker’s bill proposes to “prohibit qualified amateur sports organizations from prohibiting or substantially restricting the use of an athletes name, image, or likeness.” Senator Chris Murphy has also taken up the cause of fair compensation for college athletes, a position highlighted in his recently-released “Madness, Inc” commentary. Vermont Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders recently tweeted “College athletes are workers. Pay them.” So too has fellow candidate Andrew Yang. It should be clear then that SB206 is not a lone voice calling for change, but rather part of a growing legislative chorus calling for an end to the exploitation of college athletes.
Moreover, the California bill does not prevent any other state’s colleges and universities from participating in the NCAA cartel’s collusive restrictions. Nor does it prevent California’s own schools from continuing to collude with other NCAA members to limit athlete compensation in other areas. The bill simply says that California universities cannot participate in cartel restrictions only with regard to NIL rights. In raising a Commerce Clause challenge on this issue, the NCAA would offer the absurd argument that SB206’s removal of a restraint on trade should be subordinate to a cartel’s nationwide imposition of that same restraint, a position at clear odds with the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Any claim that the bill would “burden” interstate commerce is suspect for at least two other reasons. First, the bill does not impose additional regulations. Rather it deregulates, freeing college athletes from the economic restraints imposed upon their own identities by the NCAA, an economic cartel that has lost the last two antitrust cases it has faced. Second, the benefits to athletes are not local. Colleges and universities in California, like any other state, recruit nationally and internationally. As such, the NIL benefits would not be restricted by any state boundary. Further, any third party may compensate athletes competing for California schools in exchange for their NIL rights, not just California companies or individuals.
The NCAA may also claim that the bill would give California schools a recruiting advantage over out-of-state competitors, particularly for players with the ability to monetize their NIL rights. However, California schools, including both USC and Stanford, have voiced their opposition to the bill. The sheer prospect of having to share their collusively-extracted gains with the labor that generated them apparently overwhelms any perceived recruiting advantage.
The financial stakes offer some insight into why California schools oppose the bill. In 2016, UCLA signed a 15-year, $280 million apparel contract with Under Armour (see other schools’ contracts here). Apparel contracts can have implications beyond the athletic department. Documents from the UNC-Chapel Hill show that the school’s Nike contract included $2 million used by the chancellor to protect non-tenure track positions in the College of Arts & Sciences, School of Nursing, and School of Education. These details underscore the immense value schools extract from the success of their athletic programs, success that is built upon the work of college athletes, whose NIL rights the schools have colluded to appropriate.
Finally, the NCAA will likely attempt to revisit the Ninth Circuit’s decision in O’Bannon, which held that payments to athletes should be “tethered to education.” This provided the support for providing college athletes with an approximately $2,500 to $5,000 “cost-of-attendance” (COA) stipend, a move the NCAA fought. While these COA payments provide a small measure of relief, particularly given evidence that 86 percent of college athletes live below the poverty line, consider this: During this year’s PAC-12 basketball tournament, Commissioner Larry Scott, whose $4.8 million annual salary exceeds that of the Big Ten and SEC Commissioners combined, stayed in a 3,300 square-foot, $7,500 per night suite at the Aria Las Vegas. A few months earlier, during the Alston v. NCAA trial, Scott pontificated about the “purity” of the college game, the same “purity” that pays his salary and lifestyle. This of course, does not even begin to address the racial component of this injustice, a topic that journalist Patrick Hruby explored in his excellent 2016 article “Four Years A Student-Athlete: The Racial Injustice of Big-Time College Sports.”
Allowing NIL payments would offer additional education-related benefits. First, for many athletes with uncertain pro futures debating early entry into the professional ranks, NIL payments would allow them to stay in school and finish their degrees without being compelled by financial considerations to make a risky bet. Basketball agents acknowledged this reality in a letter sent to the NCAA this past weekend, explaining that “Every year, men’s basketball student-athletes continue to make poor decisions on whether to remain in the NBA Draft or return to school.” Former Georgetown guard L.J Peak, in Sam Vecenie’s 2017 Vice article, explained how financial considerations led him to leave early and enter his name into the NBA draft, despite expecting to be a second-round pick at best. Allowing NIL payments would benefit fans as well, who often complain about early entry’s effect on roster turnover, a point that addresses the NCAA’s “consumer demand” defense for amateurism.
Second, it would relieve many athletes, on whose success their families often depend, from significant stress. In 2015, the University of Mississippi’s Laremy Tunsil, one of the top football players in arguably the nation’s top college football conference, the SEC, was forced to ask coaches for assistance with his mother’s $305 power and water bill. One might wonder if this sum would have covered even a single room service delivery at Larry Scott’s Aria suite. Meanwhile, in the O’Bannon antitrust trial, the NCAA paid one of its economic experts, who argued against compensating athletes for their NIL rights, $2300 per hour. Two hours of this expert’s time in 2013 cost more than an entire year’s COA stipend for an out-of-state football player at Alabama in 2015.
While not every athlete could parlay their NIL into a contract with Nike or Coca-Cola, a large number would likely sign smaller endorsement deals with local businesses. The name of an athlete on a little-known product, or perhaps a local doctor’s office or car dealership, can yield financial benefits that can make the difference between struggling financially and being able to remain in school and perhaps help her/his family.
Despite its chest-thumping, the NCAA argues against SB206 from a position of legal, economic, and moral weakness. Public opinion, which the NCAA has attempted to sway with its widely-mocked propaganda campaigns, has begun to turn against “amateurism.” Terren Klein, CEO of College Pulse, recently told CNBC’s Make It, “The majority of students are in favor of paying student-athletes and give overwhelming support for allowing student-athletes to profit off their name and image.” And before one casually dismisses college students’ opinions on the matter, the University of Alabama apparently finds their participation important enough to track fourth-quarter early student departures from football games.
The NCAA’s threats of a sports apocalypse if athletes were allowed to regain their own identities only expose it as a decrepit and morally bankrupt institution struggling to maintain its economic stranglehold over the lives of young athletes. Thanks to legislators such as Nancy Skinner, Chris Murphy, and others who have taken up the fight for economic justice, the NCAA’s grip has begun to loosen.

San Francisco Media Company,"United States, San Francisco","Mar 5, 2019",Judge rejects Trump administration’s attempt to withhold public safety grants from sanctuary cities,"A federal judge on Monday struck down conditions the Trump administration tried to place on federal law enforcement grants that could have blocked sanctuary cities like San Francisco from receiving the funding.
Judge William H. Orrick found unconstitutional conditions the Department of Justice placed on its 2018 public safety grants. The ruling is in line with an earlier decision striking down similar conditions placed on the same types of grants in 2017.
One new condition in the 2018 grants was a requirement prohibiting a grant recipient from disclosing information “of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection any fugitive from justice.” The Department of Justice argued the condition was needed after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf warned immigrants in February 2018 of an imminent raid in the Bay Area by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Orrick’s ruling noted that “The crux of DOJ’s argument relies on an incident where the Oakland’s mayor informed residents of an impending federal immigration operation on social media, allegedly compromising the operation and law enforcement safety.”
But Orrick said the proposed non-disclosure condition was too broad and struck it down.
City Attorney Dennis Herrera announced the ruling Monday and noted it was his third legal victory against Trump administration attempts to overturn policies protecting immigrants in sanctuary cities.
Sanctuary policies restrict local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials. Supporters of sanctuary policies argue cities are safer when immigrants can report crimes to local law enforcement without fear of deportation.
“Justice has prevailed once again,” Herrera said in a statement. “These grant conditions were yet another example of presidential overreach, and the court rightly struck them down. This is a victory for the rule of law and common-sense law enforcement. Congress has the power of the purse. The president does not. I suggest this administration stop trying to villainize immigrants and instead read the Constitution.”
Monday’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed by San Francisco in U.S. District Court that sought to overturn conditions placed on 2018 law enforcement grants known as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, which are doled out annually by the Department of Justice.
Herrera filed a similar lawsuit over conditions placed on 2017 grants that totaled about $1.4 million, and also prevailed in that case. San Francisco expects to receive the same amount from the 2018 grants.
Conditions included requirements that grant recipients allow federal agents access to jails and notify them of the release dates of noncitizens.
Orrick’s ruling reiterated findings from the 2017 case, but also addressed the non-disclosure condition.
“California and San Francisco agreed at the hearing that the desire to maintain confidentiality is reasonable and that they would not intentionally publicize confidential information concerning impending operations,” Orrick wrote in his March 4 ruling.
But, he wrote that “the condition goes well beyond the DOJ’s stated purposes.”
“Left to its core—that local jurisdictions should not publicize confidential federal law enforcement actions that are disclosed to local authorities to insure deconfliction and protect local law enforcement and residents—seems self-evident and reasonable,” he wrote. “But DOJ did not leave it to its core, and instead larded it with broad-ranging, ambiguous language that would allow DOJ the discretion to coerce local jurisdictions to comply with its interpretation of the statutes in dispute in these cases.”
Herrera also prevailed in a lawsuit filed on Jan. 31, 2017 over President Donald Trump’s executive order to deny federal funding to sanctuary cities.
Orrick ruled that the executive order violation the constitution, a ruling that was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1, 2018.

BAIER: House Speaker Paul Ryan says he will not run for reelection, igniting a battle for his leadership position in raising questions about whether Republicans can survive the midterms.
President Trump warns Russia missiles are headed for Syria. And the Kremlin says an airstrike could provoke a super power showdown.
Plus more cities are joining the effort to overturn California's sanctuary state law.
This is SPECIAL REPORT.
Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.
The number two spot in line for the presidency will have a new occupant next year. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he will not be back after the end of his current term.
That has Republicans and Democrats expressing new doubts about whether the GOP can maintain its majority in the House. And it has Ryan's colleagues jockeying for position in the race to replace him.
We have Fox team coverage from Capitol Hill tonight. Peter Doocy looks at what Ryan's retirement may mean for the midterms amid a growing roster of Republican incumbents deciding not to run again.
But we start off with chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel on an announcement most people, Mike, did not see coming, at least not today.
MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Indeed -- Bret, good evening to you.
The demands of being House Speaker are huge in terms of fund-raising, travel, and overall stress. Speaker Paul Ryan says he's had enough.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
REP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Much work remains. But I like to think I have done my part, my little part in history to set us on a better course.
EMANUEL: A source familiar says Ryan made the final decision with his wife, Janna, over Easter recess. And that as recently as February Ryan considered running for another term.
The Speaker told his staff early this morning and received a standing ovation from his team. Ryan told his Republican colleagues and reporters, family was a key consideration.
RYAN: What I realize is if I'm here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad. I just can't let that happen.
EMANUEL: Ryan also spoke by phone first thing this morning with his House GOP leadership team, Vice President Pence, and President Trump. The President saluted Ryan's service on Twitter, calling Ryan ""a truly good man who will leave an unquestionable legacy of achievement.""
Among the challenges for Ryan, a vocal bloc of House conservatives who challenged his leadership, a negotiating partner in the President who at times could be unpredictable. The President threatened to veto a $1.3 trillion pending package that he once embraced.
Another frustration was campaigning for years on repealing and replacing Obamacare and the Senate coming up short. The Senate Majority Leader noted Ryan didn't aspire to be Speaker.
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Like a true leader, Paul stepped up to the plate. He answered his colleagues' call with exactly the earnest, selfless, and focused approach that has defined his entire career in Congress.
EMANUEL: Top Democrats sang his praises too.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Speaker Ryan is a good man. He's always true to his word, even though we disagreed on most issues. In the areas where we could work together, I found him to be smart, thoughtful, and straightforward. I found him to have a great deal of integrity.
EMANUEL: Major highlight for the policy wonk was the first tax reform in more than 30 years, and his colleagues say there is still time.
REP. MIA LOVE (R), UTAH: I think Paul is going to be anything but a lame duck. I think we are going to be able to get -- get a few more things done while he's here.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
EMANUEL: In terms of what's next for the 48-year-old Ryan, sources close to him say he's not going to be having conversations with anyone about that until January -- Bret.
BAIER: Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill. Mike -- thanks.
Speaker Ryan is known as a prolific fund-raiser and cheerleader obviously for his Republican colleagues. So what will his lame duck status mean for the party entering what many believe will be a very close midterm election? Correspondent Peter Doocy has that part of the story tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In the early stages of the midterm cycle, Speaker Ryan has been crisscrossing the country.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Speaker of the House -- Speaker Paul Ryan.
DOOCY: Raising money, convincing donors to write more than $40 million worth of checks to help House Republicans maintain the majority. So why retire?
RYAN: I really don't think a person's race for Congress is going to hinge on whether Paul Ryan is speaker or not. So I really don't think it affects it.
DOOCY: The National Republican Congressional Committee led by Congressman Steve Stivers is now assessing how Ryan's departure affects its bottom line.
REP. STEVE STIVERS (R), OHIO, NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE: I believe his donor base is connected to him and will stick with him even when he's not running for speaker. But, you know, we will see what happens there.
DOOCY: In really tight races, incumbents think voters will care more about local issues that an outgoing speaker.
REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK: I'm not sure it has that much impact to be perfectly honest with you. My race is so unique to my district.
DOOCY: Ryan is one of 26 Republicans retiring from politics; 13 others are leaving to pursue different offices. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee which has been predicting Ryan would retire thinks he is just getting out because he quote, ""sees what is coming"" in November.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Paul Ryan is bailing; unfortunately for House Republicans, they all are still stuck with his agenda.
DOOCY: That agenda may determine which Republican is picked to succeed Ryan. One possibility -- Majority Whip Steve Scalise.
REP. STEVE SCALISE (R), LOUISIANA, HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: I think what's most important is that we stay focused on working with President Trump to get our economy back on track and we are doing that.
DOOCY: Another possibility -- Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: We've got a lot of work to do and focus on keeping the majority; nothing about a speaker race.
DOOCY: That's why Republicans don't see a speaker's race impacting November's contest with one exception.
STIVERS: The one place that might have some impact is if people are speculating that Nancy Pelosi might be speaker. It might motivate the base.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
DOOCY: Democrats insist they've got the motivated base and that if Ryan thought Republicans would still be in the majority this time next year, he wouldn't be leaving. But Republicans believe the retirement is a one-day story -- Bret.
BAIER: We will see. Peter, live on the hill. Peter -- thanks. More on this with the panel.
Almost four dozen Republicans resigning or retiring from the House, three Republican senators. So what do you think of Ryan's decision? What do you think it will mean potentially for the midterms if anything? Let me know on Twitter @BretBaier and use the #SpecialReport or on Facebook at Facebook.com/BretBaiersr.
Now to other stories.
The situation between the U.S., Syria and Russia could hardly be more tense tonight. President Trump is threatening or promising to launch air strikes against Syria over alleged chemical attacks on civilians there.
Russia, Syria's major ally, says such an attack would be an act of war, inviting a military response.
Chief White House correspondent John Roberts tells us what he is hearing from the administration tonight. Good evening -- John.
JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening.
At this point in time, a military strike against Syria certainly looks likely and all sides are rattling sabers in a way that we haven't seen before. But a couple big questions remain. Was this actually a chemical attack and is there a way to avoid air strikes?
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ROBERTS: A military strike against Syria is on a hot boil at the White House but the press secretary Sarah Sanders saying today it may not be inevitable.
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: That is certainly one option but that doesn't mean it's the only option.
ROBERTS: In a tweet this morning, President Trump suggested a missile strike was imminent, taunting Russia which has threatened to shoot down American missiles over Syria. The President tweeting, ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart. You shouldn't be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it.""
The tweet brought howls of hypocrisy from some corners. Isn't this the same president who trashed President Obama for telegraphing his military intentions?
(CROSSTALK)
SANDERS: He certainly hasn't laid out the timetable, which would be broadcasting his intentions.
ROBERTS: Other critics took aim at the President for not having a cohesive strategy on Syria announcing one week that he wants American troops out and now threatening a military strike.
SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA: I think the President does not have a Syria strategy. And I think one off-attacks or tweets or missile strikes are not the same as a strategy.
ROBERTS: The President's national security team including Defense Secretary James Mattis huddled with the Vice President at the White House today to go over options. Mattis saying earlier today that the U.S. is still awaiting confirmation that chemical weapons were in fact used in Douma.
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: We are still assessing the intelligence ourselves and our allies. We are still working on this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is the U.S. military ready right now to conduct a retaliatory strike in --
MATTIS: We stand ready to provide military options if they are appropriate as the President determined.
ROBERTS: Russia continues to deny that chemical weapons were used. A senior military official today saying the attack was staged by rebel emergency responders, the White Helmets.
VICTOR POZNIKHIR (PH), RUSSIAN MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translator): Based on investigating the territory, visiting the medical institutions featured in the footage by the White Helmets, questioning of medical personnel and patients we found no evidence of poisoning substances or victims among residents of this town.
ROBERTS: In a series of tweets, President Trump today said, ""Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War."" And he blamed the deterioration on the Mueller investigation tweeting, ""Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the fake and corrupt Russia investigation.""
The President is still piqued about the raid on his personal attorney Michael Cohen. Part of what the FBI was looking for was documents related to the infamous Access Hollywood tape. It appears to be an attempt to link the tape to the Stormy Daniels payment.
Was Cohen trying to avoid more bad publicity to protect the campaign? Did the payment constitute an illegal political contribution? President Trump incensed that the Mueller investigation may have strayed outside bounds of its initial mandate.
SANDERS: The President certainly has been clear that he has a very deep concern about the direction of the special counsel and other investigations have taken.
ROBERTS: Is President Trump again considering firing Mueller? He has gone from flat denials to a far more ambiguous posture. Certainly the President's allies are warning against it.
SEN. CORY GARDNER (R), COLORADO: I think it would be a mistake -- a grave mistake by the President to fire Robert Mueller. I have no belief that he will.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ROBERTS: The Cohen raid may be an attempt to put pressure on Cohen to cooperate with prosecutors, threaten him with campaign finance-related charges in hopes that he will roll over on the President. Certainly, Cohen has a treasure trove of knowledge about President Trump. Flipping the President's personal attorney would mark a dramatic escalation in the momentum of this investigation -- Bret.
BAIER: John Roberts, live on the north lawn. John -- thanks.
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has just seen a copy of that FBI memo that began the bureau's probe into allegations of collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Chairman Devin Nunes had set today as the deadline for the FBI to show him that document.
Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is here to tell us what happened today. Good evening -- Catherine.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you -- Bret. And good evening.
After threatening contempt of Congress, a government source confirms to Fox News that the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes along with Congressman Trey Gowdy as well as committee staffers went to the Justice Department late today and met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and viewed a copy of the two-page FBI memo that kick started the Russia probe.
While not a clean copy as lawmakers demanded, the government source told Fox, the redactions were quote, ""minimal and justified"".
Based on Fox's reporting, the two-page memo from July 2016 was drafted by or with major input from FBI agent Peter Strzok who was removed from the special counsel Russia case after the discovery of anti-Trump text messages.
On Fox last night, Devin Nunes said legal action was warranted after months of delay by the FBI and Justice Department.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: They are not giving this to us. It tells me there's something wrong here.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: What are the chances you're going to hold them in contempt of congress right now?
NUNES: Well, I cannot tell you that we are not going to just hold them in contempt. We will have a plan to hold them in contempt and to impeach.
INGRAHAM: To impeach Christopher Wray?
NUNES: Absolutely.
INGRAHAM: Rod Rosenstein?
NUNES: We are not messing around here.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERRIDGE: Despite the eleventh-hour resolution, Fox News is told that congressional investigators remain concerned about the memo's underlying intelligence and the credibility of the sources and that it will require further investigation. We asked the FBI for comment and we are waiting to hear back from them.
But we did just hear back from the Department of Justice. They said the remaining redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the name of a foreign country as well as the name of a foreign agent -- Bret.
BAIER: Catherine -- thank you.
HERRIDGE: You're welcome.
BAIER: We will monitor that.

Fox News has obtained excerpts from Director Pompeo's opening remarks from a senior administration official.
There is an assumption in Washington that Pompeo's selection means the end of the Iran nuclear agreement. Pompeo says he is still willing to work with European allies to change the policy and keep the U.S. in the deal. He will say quote ""If confirmed, it will be an immediate personal priority to work with those partners to see if such a fix is achievable. The stakes are high for everyone, but especially Tehran.""
On the Putin regime, he will say quote, ""Russia continues to act aggressively, enabled by years of soft policy towards that aggression. That is now over. Our diplomatic efforts with Russia will prove challenging but as in previous confrontations with Moscow, must continue.""
A source close to Pompeo notes as CIA director he is already in the middle of preparations for President Trump's expected meeting with Kim Jong-un. Pompeo will say quote, ""I have read the CIA histories of previous negotiations with the North Koreans and am confident that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past. President Trump isn't one to play games at the negotiating table and I won't be either.
And if charges the he would be a war hawk as secretary, Pompeo will say quote, ""There are few who dread war more than those of us who have served in uniform. I would prefer achieving the President's foreign policy goals with unrelenting diplomacy rather than by sending young men and women to war.""
A source close to the CIA director says it's not his intent to criticize Secretary Tillerson, though Tillerson left with a morale problem here of the State Department and the source says Pompeo wants to address the immediate needs, staffing deficiencies, and work with senators in both parties to accomplish.
The source says he has spent hundreds of hours here, Pompeo, preparing for this hearing and for the eventual transition if he is confirmed. And that he has even spoken to all living secretaries of state, including Rex Tillerson and Hillary Clinton -- Bret.
BAIER: Rich Edson, live at the State Department. Rich -- thank you.
Opposition to California's status as a sanctuary state is growing. The list of communities within that state going up against the law continues to expand.
Senior correspondent Adam Housley shows us tonight from Los Angeles.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God bless Donald Trump.
ADAM HOUSLEY, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Slivers of red in one of the country's bluest states as two more cities, Newport Beach and Orange, decided to join President Trump in opposition to the California so-called sanctuary state law SB 54.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to see our border secure. I want to see a wall. And I want to see all illegal aliens systematically and aggressively removed from our country.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I encourage the council not to pass this resolution. I don't think it's necessary to take this stance at this point.
HOUSLEY: The sixth most populous county in the United States in one of the last bastions of conservatism in the Golden State, Orange County has squarely sided with President Trump as the county and now nine cities starting with Los Alamitos last month openly oppose SB 54 -- California's law that limits state and local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities while the sheriff's office has decided to opt out of following the law altogether.
The public battle is as heated as the legal one with civic debate extended for hours.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am very offended because I work very hard to be in America. And here we are protecting illegal criminals.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Of contention here is that we want to protect the immigrants that are right now afraid to report crimes, to go to school. Our community, our neighbors are afraid to walk the streets of Orange.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HOUSLEY: Also in California, the Trump administration arguing today that the President's executive order of threatening to cut funding from cities and states who won't cooperate with immigration authorities is legal. It's an appeal to a previous judge's ruling that blocked the order nationwide heard by a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit -- Bret.
BAIER: Adam Housley in Los Angeles. Adam -- thank you.
Several people in the counterterrorism community are calling Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a liar. We will tell you why when we come back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BAIER: President Trump says he's making progress with China over its trade policies. That was part of a Twitter posting from the President this morning. ""So much fake news about what is going on in the White House,"" he tweeted. ""Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria. Feels great to have (national security advisor) John Bolton and (National Economic Council director) Larry Kudlow on board. I, we, are doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never-ending and corrupt Russia investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. No collusion or obstruction other than I fight back, so now they do the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information. Bad.""
Stocks were down today. The Dow lost 219. The S&P 500 fell 15. The Nasdaq dropped 25.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says there will be some regulation of Internet firms. Zuckerberg made that prediction during testimony today before House lawmakers -- his second straight day of answering questions from Congress.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: The Internet is growing in importance around the world, in people's lives. And I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.
So my position is not that there should be no regulation but I also think that you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Some on the counterterrorism community are calling Zuckerberg a liar tonight. They say his statements about cleaning up extremism from the social media site are just not true.
Correspondent Gillian Turner looks at the allegations tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ZUCKERBERG: 99 percent of the ISIS and al Qaeda content that we take down on Facebook are AI systems flagged before any human sees it.
GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mark Zuckerberg may have said all the right things this week in his testimony about Facebook's push to eradicate terrorist content from its platform but the counterterrorism community says it's not true. Facebook is failing when it comes to combating terrorism.
TARA MALLER, COUNTER EXTREMISIM PROJECT: We're not actually seeing that translate into the reduction of terrorist content on these platforms. We are not actually seeing ISIS bomb-making videos permanently removed.
TURNER: And Congress is piling on; one lawmaker citing two instances from the past ten days alone.
REP. SUSAN BROOKS (R), INDIANA: ISIS content was discovered on Facebook which included an execution video, March 29. On April 9, there were five pages located on April 9th of Hezbollah content.
TURNER: A big part of the problem, according to terrorism expert is that Facebook officials are still relying on its users to report terrorist activity and content when they should be policing the platform themselves.
MALLER: On the scale that they have now, they can't just sit back and let users report problematic content. If you're using that as a standard, you're never going to even make a small blip on the radar screen in terms of what's happening on this platforms.
TURNER: Other experts caution that Facebook may never get this problem fully under control.
STEVEN BUCCI, CYBER SECURITY EXPERT: You're talking about massive, massive amount of data, even more than the intel community normally deals with on a day-to-day basis. It's a herculean task to think that they are going to be able to cull through all that information and find the bad guys other than the ones who are really, really obvious about it.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
TURNER: Zuckerberg told lawmakers today a new beefed-up counterterrorism team of 200 people inside Facebook is the answer. But the real Holy Grail for Facebook and other social media companies when it comes to controlling access to their platforms is more advanced artificial intelligence something Zuckerberg says is currently in development -- Bret.
BAIER: Gillian -- thank you.
California Democrat Governor Jerry Brown has agreed to deploy 400 National Guard troops at President Trump's request but not all will head to the U.S.-Mexico border as the President wants and none will enforce federal immigration law, according to the governor. Brown says the mission will not include building a wall or rounding up illegal immigrants.
President Trump wants up to 4,000 National Guard troops sent to the border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking and has already won commitments without disclaimers for about 1,600 from Republican governors of other states that border Mexico -- Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
Up next congressional Republicans have buyer's remorse over tax cuts and spending.
First here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.
WDRB In Louisville as Kentucky's Democratic attorney general and unions representing teachers and police officers sue to block a bill that would make changes to one of the countries worst funded public pension systems.
Republican Governor Matt Bevin signed the bill into law yesterday. Thousands of teachers have protested that measure with marches at the state capitol -- part of ongoing demonstrations across the country.
Fox 32 in Chicago as an aviation security officer fired after forcibly dragging a passenger from a plane last year files a lawsuit against United Airlines and the city of Chicago. James Long was one of the officers called to a plane after a man refused to give up his seat. Video taken by other passenger shows Long dragging the passenger from the plane. Long was fired in August.
And this is a live look in Salt Lake City from our affiliate Fox 13 out there. One of big stories there tonight, Mitt Romney has gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot in the U.S. Senate race, but which ballot that is, remains to be seen. Depending on what happens at next week's Utah Republican Party state convention Romney will either face a primary election or B, the party's nominee in November.
That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.
We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BAIER: Tonight congressional Republicans are trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube essentially. After going along with the President's tax cuts and a huge spending bill, many are now looking for a way to turn back the clock and reduce what could be historic deficit numbers.
Correspondent Doug McKelway tells us what they are up against.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
SEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE: This Congress and this administration likely will go down as one of the most fiscally irresponsible administrations and Congress that we have had.
DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That confession today after the Congressional Budget Office chief said that the recently passed tax bill and spending bill combined will cost deficits to grow by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Corker is not the only one flummoxed by the one-two punch of that forecast. The president's new economic chief this week is sending Congress a package to trim back what it budgeted last month.
LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: We are looking at an enhanced rescission package. I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out.
MCKELWAY: He's right. House conservatives fresh from an Easter scolding by constituents for what they consider to be reckless spending will vote tomorrow on a balanced budget amendment. But a two-thirds majority is required and Democrats won't bite.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: They go forward and call this so-called balanced budget amendment, it's not balanced and it should not be an amendment to the constitution.
The CBO did acknowledge the tax cuts have helped stimulate the economy. The treasury secretary believes there is more to come.
STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We are really just beginning to see the important economic aspects of that.
MCKELWAY: But neither party appears capable taking responsibility for outlays that outpace revenues. The single biggest cause of it, the aging of America and resulted entitlements, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
SEN. MIKE ENZI (R), WYOMING, SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You said that I said cut Medicare and Social Security. I have never said cut them.
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: If I misquoted you, then I am sorry. But some of your colleagues especially in the House have talked about cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
MCKELWAY: Speaker Paul Ryan is one of the few who has attempted reforming entitlements, and he is leaving soon. And now a new deficit threat may emerge, a long feared rise in interest rates.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just the net interest payments is going to triple over the next 10 years. That's bigger than all of defense spending.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MCKELWAY: The good news is while critics scoffed when the Trump administration claimed it could achieve three percent growth in the economy, in fact it did so for three quarters in a row. Bret?
BAIER: Doug, thank you.
Former House Speaker John Boehner says he has had a change of heart on marijuana and will now promote its nationwide legalization. Boehner has joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings, a multistate cannabis company. He says he believes legalizing marijuana can be helpful to the nation's veterans. He wants to allow the Veterans Affairs Department to offer marijuana as a treatment option.
A strange situation tonight in the Colorado governor's race, questions about the validity of voters' signatures used to get on the ballot for the Republican side of the ticket. Correspondent Alicia Acuna has detail tonight from Denver.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The announcement hit the Colorado governor's race like a political earthquake.
WALKER STAPLETON, (R) COLORADO GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: In good conscience I cannot be put on the ballot in this manner, and I will not.
ACUNA: The GOP frontrunner Walker Stapleton says the petition to place him on the June primary ballot is fraudulent, and","Baier, Bret; McKelway, Doug; Acuna, Alicia; Williams, Juan; Emanuel, Mike; Doocy, Peter; Roberts, John; Herridge, Catherine; Rich, Edson; Housley, Adam; Turner, Gillian",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2024230588/citation/9B6BED0D9BA544BBPQ/4?accountid=12826
Reason Foundation,"United States, Washington","Feb 12, 2018","Short Circuit: A roundup of recent federal court decisions: An eggregrious price fixing scheme, a tear gas accident, and a post-SWAT raid code inspection.","Please enjoy the latest edition of Short Circuit, a weekly feature from the Institute for Justice.
It would be a great victory for good food and good sense if two bills recently filed in the California and Arizona legislatures were passed into law, says IJ Reporting and Communications Associate Matt Powers. The bills would legalize mobile vending and food trucks, respectively, barring cities from imposing anticompetitive regulations while permitting local officials to address real health and safety issues.

* Regulators erred, says the D.C. Circuit, in applying a Dodd-Frank rule requiring ""securitizers"" of asset-backed securities to retain 5 percent of the credit risk (so as to ensure they have skin in the game) to plaintiffs, who transfer such securities in the course of their business but do not originate or hold a stake in them. Thus, they cannot ""retain"" an interest, nor can the agencies require them to ""obtain"" one. Chevron deference does not apply because there is no ambiguity in the statute.
* Several egg producers adopt measures to improve living conditions for hens. But wait! Are the measures, which reduce output, just a pretext to raise prices? Several food companies: Indeed, it's an illegal price-fixing scheme that cost us $111 mil. District court: The food companies can and do buy from other producers. Case dismissed. Third Circuit: Reversed.
* Paraplegic man files 385 lawsuits in 306 days against Austin, Tex.-area businesses for failing to accommodate his accessibility needs. At a hearing, it emerges that his attorney provided him with a list of businesses to attempt to patronize and that he could not identify a single business he had sued and then revisited. Fifth Circuit: He can't pursue damages; no need to reconsider a contempt order against his attorney.
* A student suspended from university for sexual misconduct can sue the school for systematically discriminating against men in its adjudication process, says the Sixth Circuit. He can also sue a member of the university hearing panel (who served as investigator, prosecutor, and judge) for failing to act as a neutral arbiter by, for instance, claiming at the hearing that ""I'll bet you do this all the time"" and withholding the report detailing the evidence against him.
* Allegation: Officer orders Clarkston, Mich. pedestrian suspected of being suspicious to stop. The man continues walking and then runs after he's told he'll be cuffed. Thinking he made good his escape, the man lies down in a backyard; the officer catches up, punches him 15 to 20 times in the head. Sixth Circuit (over a dissent): Despite pleading guilty to pot possession and resisting arrest, the man can sue the officer for using excessive force.
* Toddler plays on stanchion in Chicago coffee shop while his parents focus their attention elsewhere. It upends; his finger must be amputated. Was the shop at fault? The Seventh Circuit says no; the parents' presence abrogated any duty of care Starbucks may have owed the child.
* Allegation: St. Louis SWAT team raids home. An hour later, a city building inspector demands that a resident, who is still cuffed, sign a consent-to-search form—or his family will be put out on the street and the home condemned. District court: The family can't sue the police. But they can sue the inspector and the city. Eighth Circuit: The family can't sue the inspector.
* A San Francisco law forbidding landlords from converting their rental properties into condos for 10 years, if they buy out two or more tenants in the same building first, satisfies rational basis review, says the Ninth Circuit.
* Jury: Tulsa, Okla. jail officer sexually assaulted underage inmate numerous times over several months. Tenth Circuit: The sheriff, by choosing to hold female juveniles in adult jail in an isolated area (in 23-hour a day confinement) with no surveillance cameras and often just one guard on duty, was deliberately indifferent to the risk. No need to reconsider the jury's $25k award.
* In wake of fatal Tulsa, Okla. police shooting, man posts messages to the police department's online complaint form asserting that officers and their families will be killed. Tenth Circuit: The messages were true threats and so not protected by the First Amendment.
* Displeased that flight attendants have ceased serving him alcohol and have asked him to stop touching them, passenger yells abuse, profanities for an hour and a half. He's convicted of intimidating flight attendants. Does the law violate his free speech rights? It does not, says the Tenth Circuit.
* To subdue agitated inmate in Draper, Utah prison recreation yard, officers drop tear gas. Yikes! The prison's ventilation intake is in the yard; gas gets pumped into the prison. Tenth Circuit: Qualified immunity.
* Tennessee state forensic scientists have a financial incentive to secure DUI convictions, says a Tennessee appeals court, as the $250 fee imposed on guilty motorists pays their salaries (and some of their positions were nearly cut in a recent budget crunch). Which violates due process.
* Former Florida felons who wish to have their voting rights restored must apply to a state board, which has unfettered discretion to reinstate them—or not. Plaintiffs: There is some evidence the board looks more favorably on white applicants and applicants who espouse conservative political views. District court: The state can permanently ban felons from voting, but if it allows for re-enfranchisement, the First Amendment says the restoration process can't be arbitrary (see, among other things, Citizens United).

In 2016, South Carolina legislators banned online eye exams, a safe and salutary innovation that makes obtaining prescriptions for corrective lenses more convenient and affordable. Written by lobbyists for optometrists, the law is not intended to protect the public; rather it's meant to protect optometrists from competition—which violates the state's constitution. So Opternative, an internet startup, teamed up with IJ to challenge the law. Last month, however, a state trial court ruled that the law—which was specifically enacted to outlaw Opternative—does not harm the company, and so the suit cannot proceed. We will appeal.
