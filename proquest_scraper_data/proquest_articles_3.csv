New York Times Company,"United States, New York","Jul 3, 2019",Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Blocking Trump From Using Defense Funds for Border Wall,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Wednesday upheld a block on President Trump’s attempt to use $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense to construct a wall along the southwestern border, impeding the delivery of one of his signature campaign promises.
The divided three-judge panel in the Ninth Circuit agreed with a lower court’s decision from Friday that ruled the Trump administration did not have the authority to reallocate the funds without congressional approval. The administration immediately appealed.
Two of the three judges on the panel affirmed that the administration could not build the barriers during future challenges.
“We conclude that it is best served by respecting the Constitution’s assignment of the power of the purse to Congress, and by deferring to Congress’s understanding of the public interest as reflected in its repeated denial of more funding for border barrier construction,” wrote Judges Michelle Friedland, an Obama appointee, and Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush appointee.
Judge N. Randy Smith, also a Bush appointee, dissented, calling the ruling “an uncharted and risky approach.”
“This approach is in contradiction to the most fundamental concepts of judicial review,” Judge Smith said. “The majority has created a constitutional issue where none previously existed.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Sierra Club, hailed the freezing of the funds as a victory.
“Congress and now two courts have said no to border wall funds,” Dror Ladin, a staff attorney with the A.C.L.U., said in a statement Friday. “For the sake of our democracy and border communities, it’s time the president come to terms with the fact that America rejected his xenophobic wall — and move on.”
As a surge of migrants arrived at the United States border, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency in February to reallocate funds from counterdrug programs of the Department of Defense to build more barriers. This came after a monthslong impasse between the White House and Congress, and a partial government shutdown over funding construction of the wall.
The move to reallocate the funds, which critics of the administration said contradicted the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution, was then challenged in two separate lawsuits.
Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California temporarily blocked part of Mr. Trump’s plan to build the wall in May. On Friday, Judge Gilliam again blocked the efforts, describing the plan as “unlawful.”
On Tuesday, a federal judge in Seattle blocked another attempt by the administration to deter migration.
Judge Marsha J. Pechman of United States District Court for the Western District of Washington stopped the administration from denying a bond hearing to migrants who crossed the border illegally, which would have kept them jailed until they received a decision on an immigration case.
The administration on Wednesday called that ruling “at war with the rule of law.”

California Senator Nancy Skinner’s Senate Bill 206 would permit athletes to earn outside compensation from the use of their own name, image, and likeness (NIL)—and it unanimously flew through both houses of the state legislature. SB206, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature, has drawn sharp warnings from the NCAA, as the bill threatens its ability to exploit college athletes participating under its model of “amateurism.”
Given the NCAA’s threats, one might assume that the bill’s passage would result in some cataclysmic event, threatening the very existence of college sports. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The act would merely allow athletes to enjoy (almost) the same rights over their own identities that every student at their school enjoys, unencumbered by NCAA cartel restrictions. Even these rights are limited, as athletes could not enter into an agreement that conflicts with a team’s existing contracts.
The prospect of returning even a portion of NIL rights to college athletes has prompted howls of dismay from the NCAA and its acolytes. On June 17, 2019, NCAA President Mark Emmert sent a letter requesting that the State Senate postpone consideration of the bill. More recently, the NCAA informed Governor Newsom that it regarded the bill as “unconstitutional,” signaling an intention to rely on the Constitution’s Commerce Clause to raise a legal challenge. The letter also claimed that SB206 would upend the “level playing field” that the NCAA claims it has supported in college athletics. 
Those familiar with the O’Bannon v. NCAA case may be hard pressed to stifle their laughter upon seeing the NCAA trot out such risible, well-refuted claims. During the O’Bannon trial, plaintiffs’ counsel presented a quote from NCAA special advisor Wally Renfro, a 40-year veteran of the institution, who in an email titled “Financial Underpinnings of Athletics,” referred to Division I membership as “the haves, the have-nots, and the forget-about-its.” Indeed, so wide is the disparity that the “Power Five” conference football programs routinely make “guarantee game” payments to smaller teams. For example, Tulane received $1.94 million for playing SEC powerhouse Auburn earlier this year. In her O’Bannon ruling, District Judge Claudia Wilken, citing academic consensus on the matter, rejected the NCAA’s competitive balance justification, opining that:
The NCAA does not do anything to rein in spending by the high-revenue schools or minimize existing disparities in revenue and recruiting … the major conferences—and the highest revenue schools—typically receive the greatest payouts, which hinders, rather than promotes, competitive balance.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Wilken’s ruling on this point. In the subsequent Alston v. NCAA case, the NCAA, perhaps sensing a lost cause, did not even request that the court reconsider its competitive balance justification for its restraint on athlete compensation. 
Some athletes can already be paid in cash for their athletic talents. NCAA athletes competing in the Olympics receive cash payment for medaling in their sport. As CBS’s Dennis Dodd pointed out in 2018, University of Texas swimmer Joseph Schooling received $753,000 as payment for his gold medal from his native Singapore. He still won six medals at the NCAA championships. Kyler Murray received a $4.7 million bonus from the Oakland Athletics, yet remained eligible to quarterback the Oklahoma Sooners. As long as this was not football money, the NCAA concluded that he was eligible to keep playing, though his college baseball career was over.
Clearly the NCAA’s real concern lies with the prospect that college athletes in the major revenue sports of basketball and football might receive something more than table scraps for the extraordinary sums they garner for their schools. Those arguing that athletes receive an “education” in exchange for their 40-plus hours per week of labor and the millions they bring to the school may want to revisit the long-standing academic fraud case at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, one of the most respected public universities in the nation.
Nonetheless, the NCAA’s “level playing field” canard does signal at least an attempt, serious or not, to lean on Ninth Circuit precedent set in the 1992 NCAA v. Miller case, which involved NCAA sanctions against then-coach Jerry Tarkanian and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. There, the NCAA challenged various provisions of Nevada statute NRS 398 that set forth the state’s guidelines for the imposition of NCAA sanctions upon any college or university in the state. The district court found that the Nevada statute was “significantly burdensome on the NCAA’s objective of maintaining a ‘level playing field’ within intercollegiate athletics.” The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the practical effect of the regulation would have been to control conduct beyond the state’s boundaries.
However, this finding has little relevance for the California State Senate Bill. State and federal legislators have begun to chip away at the NCAA cartel’s economic control over college athletes. South Carolina lawmakers recently announced plans to file a bill similar to SB206. North Carolina Representative Mark Walker has introduced H.R. 1804, the Student-Athlete Equity Act, which has been referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. Representative Walker’s bill proposes to “prohibit qualified amateur sports organizations from prohibiting or substantially restricting the use of an athletes name, image, or likeness.” Senator Chris Murphy has also taken up the cause of fair compensation for college athletes, a position highlighted in his recently-released “Madness, Inc” commentary. Vermont Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders recently tweeted “College athletes are workers. Pay them.” So too has fellow candidate Andrew Yang. It should be clear then that SB206 is not a lone voice calling for change, but rather part of a growing legislative chorus calling for an end to the exploitation of college athletes.
Moreover, the California bill does not prevent any other state’s colleges and universities from participating in the NCAA cartel’s collusive restrictions. Nor does it prevent California’s own schools from continuing to collude with other NCAA members to limit athlete compensation in other areas. The bill simply says that California universities cannot participate in cartel restrictions only with regard to NIL rights. In raising a Commerce Clause challenge on this issue, the NCAA would offer the absurd argument that SB206’s removal of a restraint on trade should be subordinate to a cartel’s nationwide imposition of that same restraint, a position at clear odds with the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Any claim that the bill would “burden” interstate commerce is suspect for at least two other reasons. First, the bill does not impose additional regulations. Rather it deregulates, freeing college athletes from the economic restraints imposed upon their own identities by the NCAA, an economic cartel that has lost the last two antitrust cases it has faced. Second, the benefits to athletes are not local. Colleges and universities in California, like any other state, recruit nationally and internationally. As such, the NIL benefits would not be restricted by any state boundary. Further, any third party may compensate athletes competing for California schools in exchange for their NIL rights, not just California companies or individuals.
The NCAA may also claim that the bill would give California schools a recruiting advantage over out-of-state competitors, particularly for players with the ability to monetize their NIL rights. However, California schools, including both USC and Stanford, have voiced their opposition to the bill. The sheer prospect of having to share their collusively-extracted gains with the labor that generated them apparently overwhelms any perceived recruiting advantage.
The financial stakes offer some insight into why California schools oppose the bill. In 2016, UCLA signed a 15-year, $280 million apparel contract with Under Armour (see other schools’ contracts here). Apparel contracts can have implications beyond the athletic department. Documents from the UNC-Chapel Hill show that the school’s Nike contract included $2 million used by the chancellor to protect non-tenure track positions in the College of Arts & Sciences, School of Nursing, and School of Education. These details underscore the immense value schools extract from the success of their athletic programs, success that is built upon the work of college athletes, whose NIL rights the schools have colluded to appropriate.
Finally, the NCAA will likely attempt to revisit the Ninth Circuit’s decision in O’Bannon, which held that payments to athletes should be “tethered to education.” This provided the support for providing college athletes with an approximately $2,500 to $5,000 “cost-of-attendance” (COA) stipend, a move the NCAA fought. While these COA payments provide a small measure of relief, particularly given evidence that 86 percent of college athletes live below the poverty line, consider this: During this year’s PAC-12 basketball tournament, Commissioner Larry Scott, whose $4.8 million annual salary exceeds that of the Big Ten and SEC Commissioners combined, stayed in a 3,300 square-foot, $7,500 per night suite at the Aria Las Vegas. A few months earlier, during the Alston v. NCAA trial, Scott pontificated about the “purity” of the college game, the same “purity” that pays his salary and lifestyle. This of course, does not even begin to address the racial component of this injustice, a topic that journalist Patrick Hruby explored in his excellent 2016 article “Four Years A Student-Athlete: The Racial Injustice of Big-Time College Sports.”
Allowing NIL payments would offer additional education-related benefits. First, for many athletes with uncertain pro futures debating early entry into the professional ranks, NIL payments would allow them to stay in school and finish their degrees without being compelled by financial considerations to make a risky bet. Basketball agents acknowledged this reality in a letter sent to the NCAA this past weekend, explaining that “Every year, men’s basketball student-athletes continue to make poor decisions on whether to remain in the NBA Draft or return to school.” Former Georgetown guard L.J Peak, in Sam Vecenie’s 2017 Vice article, explained how financial considerations led him to leave early and enter his name into the NBA draft, despite expecting to be a second-round pick at best. Allowing NIL payments would benefit fans as well, who often complain about early entry’s effect on roster turnover, a point that addresses the NCAA’s “consumer demand” defense for amateurism.
Second, it would relieve many athletes, on whose success their families often depend, from significant stress. In 2015, the University of Mississippi’s Laremy Tunsil, one of the top football players in arguably the nation’s top college football conference, the SEC, was forced to ask coaches for assistance with his mother’s $305 power and water bill. One might wonder if this sum would have covered even a single room service delivery at Larry Scott’s Aria suite. Meanwhile, in the O’Bannon antitrust trial, the NCAA paid one of its economic experts, who argued against compensating athletes for their NIL rights, $2300 per hour. Two hours of this expert’s time in 2013 cost more than an entire year’s COA stipend for an out-of-state football player at Alabama in 2015.
While not every athlete could parlay their NIL into a contract with Nike or Coca-Cola, a large number would likely sign smaller endorsement deals with local businesses. The name of an athlete on a little-known product, or perhaps a local doctor’s office or car dealership, can yield financial benefits that can make the difference between struggling financially and being able to remain in school and perhaps help her/his family.
Despite its chest-thumping, the NCAA argues against SB206 from a position of legal, economic, and moral weakness. Public opinion, which the NCAA has attempted to sway with its widely-mocked propaganda campaigns, has begun to turn against “amateurism.” Terren Klein, CEO of College Pulse, recently told CNBC’s Make It, “The majority of students are in favor of paying student-athletes and give overwhelming support for allowing student-athletes to profit off their name and image.” And before one casually dismisses college students’ opinions on the matter, the University of Alabama apparently finds their participation important enough to track fourth-quarter early student departures from football games.
The NCAA’s threats of a sports apocalypse if athletes were allowed to regain their own identities only expose it as a decrepit and morally bankrupt institution struggling to maintain its economic stranglehold over the lives of young athletes. Thanks to legislators such as Nancy Skinner, Chris Murphy, and others who have taken up the fight for economic justice, the NCAA’s grip has begun to loosen.

San Francisco Media Company,"United States, San Francisco","Mar 5, 2019",Judge rejects Trump administration’s attempt to withhold public safety grants from sanctuary cities,"A federal judge on Monday struck down conditions the Trump administration tried to place on federal law enforcement grants that could have blocked sanctuary cities like San Francisco from receiving the funding.
Judge William H. Orrick found unconstitutional conditions the Department of Justice placed on its 2018 public safety grants. The ruling is in line with an earlier decision striking down similar conditions placed on the same types of grants in 2017.
One new condition in the 2018 grants was a requirement prohibiting a grant recipient from disclosing information “of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection any fugitive from justice.” The Department of Justice argued the condition was needed after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf warned immigrants in February 2018 of an imminent raid in the Bay Area by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Orrick’s ruling noted that “The crux of DOJ’s argument relies on an incident where the Oakland’s mayor informed residents of an impending federal immigration operation on social media, allegedly compromising the operation and law enforcement safety.”
But Orrick said the proposed non-disclosure condition was too broad and struck it down.
City Attorney Dennis Herrera announced the ruling Monday and noted it was his third legal victory against Trump administration attempts to overturn policies protecting immigrants in sanctuary cities.
Sanctuary policies restrict local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials. Supporters of sanctuary policies argue cities are safer when immigrants can report crimes to local law enforcement without fear of deportation.
“Justice has prevailed once again,” Herrera said in a statement. “These grant conditions were yet another example of presidential overreach, and the court rightly struck them down. This is a victory for the rule of law and common-sense law enforcement. Congress has the power of the purse. The president does not. I suggest this administration stop trying to villainize immigrants and instead read the Constitution.”
Monday’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed by San Francisco in U.S. District Court that sought to overturn conditions placed on 2018 law enforcement grants known as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, which are doled out annually by the Department of Justice.
Herrera filed a similar lawsuit over conditions placed on 2017 grants that totaled about $1.4 million, and also prevailed in that case. San Francisco expects to receive the same amount from the 2018 grants.
Conditions included requirements that grant recipients allow federal agents access to jails and notify them of the release dates of noncitizens.
Orrick’s ruling reiterated findings from the 2017 case, but also addressed the non-disclosure condition.
“California and San Francisco agreed at the hearing that the desire to maintain confidentiality is reasonable and that they would not intentionally publicize confidential information concerning impending operations,” Orrick wrote in his March 4 ruling.
But, he wrote that “the condition goes well beyond the DOJ’s stated purposes.”
“Left to its core—that local jurisdictions should not publicize confidential federal law enforcement actions that are disclosed to local authorities to insure deconfliction and protect local law enforcement and residents—seems self-evident and reasonable,” he wrote. “But DOJ did not leave it to its core, and instead larded it with broad-ranging, ambiguous language that would allow DOJ the discretion to coerce local jurisdictions to comply with its interpretation of the statutes in dispute in these cases.”
Herrera also prevailed in a lawsuit filed on Jan. 31, 2017 over President Donald Trump’s executive order to deny federal funding to sanctuary cities.
Orrick ruled that the executive order violation the constitution, a ruling that was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1, 2018.
